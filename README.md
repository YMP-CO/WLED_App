# //WLED App
Hi everyone, I am 15 years old and I decided to make my own unusual project, namely WLED App

WLED App is an application that allows you to control LED strips using WLEDs. It provides a wide range of functionality to customize your lighting, including color selection, glow modes and effects.

### App features:

- **Easy connectivity:** Easily configure WLED devices for instant control.
- **Color Customization:** Choose color palettes right in the app
- **Effect Selection:** Ability to select effects for your WLED strip

The WLED App is the perfect tool for creating stylish and personalized lighting.

⚠️ **I am not a professional coder and actively used neural networks when creating the project. Nevertheless, it turned out to be a pretty good project.**
